# LLM Test

A retro-style terminal chat application written in Go, powered by [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and [Lip Gloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss).

Inspired heavily by [cool-retro-term](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term)

Also heavily inspired by [exo](https://github.com/exo-explore/exo)

## Features

* **Multi‑tab** chat interface with a sidebar for navigation
* **Vim‑style** Normal/Insert modes
* **In‑memory clipboard** with `yy` (yank) and `p` (paste) operations
* **Optional OS‑clipboard seeding** (via `golang.design/x/clipboard`) at startup
* **Retro green‑on‑black** color scheme with lipgloss styling
* **Automatic scrolling** of chat pane when content overflows
* **Blinking cursor** and “AI thinking” animation
* Cross‑platform (macOS, Linux, Windows) with no external binary dependencies

## Requirements

* Go **1.24** or later
* A terminal supporting ANSI escape codes
